             <h2 class="colourh2">But what is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and where did it come from?</h2>
             <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. It evolved from the ground fighting techniques of Kodokan Judo, taught by masters like Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, and Soshihiro Satake.

                Over time, BJJ became its own sport thanks to the Gracie family and modern martial artists. The cool part? BJJ teaches that a smaller person can outmaneuver a bigger one using technique and leverage, with joint locks and chokeholds. Whether for fun, self-defense, or competition, BJJ has got it all!</p>
             <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations,
                 practices,
                 and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and more modern developments in martial arts. BJJ promotes the
                 concept
                 that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using
                 proper
                 technique and leverage, most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person.
                 BJJ
                 training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.</p>

            <h2>Benefits for Kids</h2>
             <p><strong>Benefits for Kids</strong>
                 Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is an excellent choice for kids, offering numerous benefits beyond just learning
                 self-defense. Hereâ€™s why BJJ is great for children:
                 <ol>
                     <li>Self-Defense Skills: Kids learn practical techniques to protect themselves, building confidence
                         and awareness.</li>
                     <li>Physical Fitness: BJJ improves strength, flexibility, and overall fitness, promoting a healthy
                         lifestyle from a young age.</li>
                     <li>Discipline and Respect: The structured training environment instills discipline, respect for
                         others, and good sportsmanship.</li>
                     <li>Problem-Solving: BJJ is often compared to a physical chess game, teaching kids to think
                         strategically and solve problems under pressure.</li>
                     <li>Fun and Engaging: Classes are designed to be fun, incorporating games and activities that keep
                         kids engaged and excited about learning.</li>
                     <li>Social Skills: Training with peers fosters teamwork, communication, and friendships that extend
                         beyond the mat.</li>
                     <li>Resilience and Perseverance: BJJ teaches kids to face challenges, overcome setbacks, and
                         develop a never-give-up attitude.</li>
