             <h2 class="colourh2">About Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</h2>
             <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling and
                 especially
                 ground fighting. BJJ was formed from Kodokan Judo ground fighting (Newaza) fundamentals that were
                 taught by
                 a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, and Soshihiro Satake.</p>
             <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations,
                 practices,
                 and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and more modern developments in martial arts. BJJ promotes the
                 concept
                 that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using
                 proper
                 technique and leverage, most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person.
                 BJJ
                 training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.</p>

             <p><strong>Benefits for Kids</strong>
                 Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is an excellent choice for kids, offering numerous benefits beyond just learning
                 self-defense. Hereâ€™s why BJJ is great for children:
                 <ol>
                     <li>Self-Defense Skills: Kids learn practical techniques to protect themselves, building confidence
                         and awareness.</li>
                     <li>Physical Fitness: BJJ improves strength, flexibility, and overall fitness, promoting a healthy
                         lifestyle from a young age.</li>
                     <li>Discipline and Respect: The structured training environment instills discipline, respect for
                         others, and good sportsmanship.</li>
                     <li>Problem-Solving: BJJ is often compared to a physical chess game, teaching kids to think
                         strategically and solve problems under pressure.</li>
                     <li>Fun and Engaging: Classes are designed to be fun, incorporating games and activities that keep
                         kids engaged and excited about learning.</li>
                     <li>Social Skills: Training with peers fosters teamwork, communication, and friendships that extend
                         beyond the mat.</li>
                     <li>Resilience and Perseverance: BJJ teaches kids to face challenges, overcome setbacks, and
                         develop a never-give-up attitude.</li>
                 </ol>
