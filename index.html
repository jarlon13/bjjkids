             <h2>About Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</h2>
             <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling and
                 especially
                 ground fighting. BJJ was formed from Kodokan Judo ground fighting (Newaza) fundamentals that were
                 taught by
                 a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, and Soshihiro Satake.</p>
             <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations,
                 practices,
                 and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and more modern developments in martial arts. BJJ promotes the
                 concept
                 that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using
                 proper
                 technique and leverage, most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person.
                 BJJ
                 training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.</p>
